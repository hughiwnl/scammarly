# Icon Files Needed

This directory should contain the following PNG icon files:

## Required Icons

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for extension toolbar)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## Icon Design

The icons should feature:
- A letter "A" in the center
- A red "X" overlay to indicate "anti-Grammarly"
- Gradient background (purple to blue)
- Small red dots around the edges to represent typos
- Clean, modern design that fits Chrome's icon style

## Creating Icons

You can:
1. Use the provided `icon.svg` as a base
2. Convert it to PNG at the required sizes
3. Use online tools like:
   - https://convertio.co/svg-png/
   - https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png
   - Or any image editor like GIMP, Photoshop, etc.

## Temporary Solution

For testing purposes, you can create simple colored squares:
- 16x16: Solid purple square
- 48x48: Solid purple square  
- 128x128: Solid purple square

The extension will work without proper icons, but they improve the user experience.
